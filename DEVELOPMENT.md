# Development Tips

This file contains helpful tips and best practices for developing and deploying the real-time whiteboard application.

## Local Development

### Using Docker Compose
- **Build and Start Services**: `docker-compose up --build`
- **Stop Services**: `docker-compose down`
- **View Logs**: `docker-compose logs -f`
- **Rebuild Services**: `docker-compose up --build --force-recreate`
- **Execute Command in Running Container**: `docker-compose exec [service] [command]`

### Using Firebase Emulator
- Start the emulator: `firebase emulators:start`
- Use for local testing of Firestore rules and API
- Change Firebase configuration to point to `localhost` during development

### Hot Reloading
- Mount volumes in `docker-compose.yml` for hot reloading:
  ```yml
  volumes:
    - ./backend:/app
    - ./static:/app/static
  ```
- Change code locally and see changes reflected immediately

## Build and Deployment

### Using Docker
- **Build Image**:
  ```bash
  docker build -t your-image-name .
  ```
- **Run Image**:
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8080:8080 your-image-name
  ```

### Using Kubernetes
- **Build and Push to Registry**: Use Docker or similar CI pipeline to push to a registry
- **Apply K8s Resources**: `kubectl apply -f k8s/`
- **Scale Applications**: `kubectl scale deployment your-deployment-name --replicas=3`

### Using Cloud Providers
- Deploy to services like AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, or Azure App Service
- Use CI/CD pipelines to automate build and deploy process

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- **Linting**: Use ESLint for JavaScript and eslint with Prettier for consistent code style
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests with popular frameworks such as Jest
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct regular code reviews to ensure quality

### Security
- **Environment Variables**: Securely manage API keys and secrets via `.env` and environment files
- **Security Audits**: Conduct regular dependency and security audits
- **Access Controls**: Use Firebase Security Rules and IAM roles

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Logging**: Use structured logging with monitoring platforms
- **Health Checks**: Implement health checks for services and dependencies
- **Tracing**: Use distributed tracing for performance monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Docker Builds**: Check Dockerfile stages for missing dependencies
- **Network Issues**: Verify network configurations and port mappings
- **Environment Issues**: Ensure environment variables are correctly set in `docker-compose.yml`

### Debugging Commands
- **Check Container Status**: `docker-compose ps`
- **View Logs**: `docker-compose logs [service]`
- **Enter Container Shell**: `docker-compose exec [service] sh`

### Resource Management
- **Scale Resources**: Adjust resource limits in Kubernetes manifests
- **Optimize Builds**: Use Docker caching effectively for faster builds
