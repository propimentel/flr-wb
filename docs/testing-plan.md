# Testing Plan for Real-time Collaborative Whiteboard

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for all components of the whiteboard application.

## Backend Testing (FastAPI)

### 1. API Endpoints
- [x] Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- [ ] Upload API (`/api/upload`)
  - File upload with authentication
  - File validation (size, type)
  - User file limit checks
  - File metadata storage
  - File listing
  - File deletion
- [ ] Admin API (`/api/admin`)
  - Cleanup operations
  - Service key authentication
- [ ] Static file serving
  - SPA fallback middleware
  - Next.js asset serving

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Firebase JWT token verification
- [ ] Protected route access
- [ ] User context extraction
- [ ] Invalid token handling

### 3. Services
- [ ] Google Cloud Storage integration
- [ ] Firestore operations
- [ ] File validation utilities
- [ ] Error handling

## Frontend Testing (Next.js + React)

### 1. Components
- [ ] Whiteboard component
  - Canvas rendering
  - Drawing functionality
  - Touch/mouse event handling
  - Real-time stroke updates
  - Drawing tools (color, size)
- [ ] Chat component
  - Message sending
  - Real-time message updates
  - User identification
- [ ] Error boundary
  - Error catching and display
- [ ] Tooltip component

### 2. Pages
- [ ] Home page (`/`)
  - User authentication states
  - Component rendering
  - Loading states
  - Error states

### 3. Contexts
- [ ] UserContext
  - Firebase initialization
  - Anonymous authentication
  - Auth state management
  - Error handling

### 4. Services
- [ ] WhiteboardService
  - Firestore integration
  - Real-time subscriptions
  - Stroke management
- [ ] ChatService
  - Message operations
  - Real-time updates

### 5. Utilities
- [ ] Drawing utilities
  - Pointer position calculation
  - Smooth line drawing
  - Point optimization
  - Canvas operations

## Shared Package Testing

### 1. Types
- [ ] TypeScript interface definitions
- [ ] Type exports

### 2. Constants
- [ ] Shared configuration values

## Integration Testing

### 1. End-to-end Workflows
- [ ] User authentication flow
- [ ] Drawing and collaboration flow
- [ ] Chat functionality flow
- [ ] File upload flow

### 2. Real-time Features
- [ ] Multi-user drawing synchronization
- [ ] Chat message propagation
- [ ] Connection handling

## Performance Testing

### 1. Frontend Performance
- [ ] Canvas rendering performance
- [ ] Memory usage during drawing
- [ ] Bundle size optimization

### 2. Backend Performance
- [ ] API response times
- [ ] File upload performance
- [ ] Database query optimization

## Security Testing

### 1. Authentication
- [ ] Token validation
- [ ] Unauthorized access prevention
- [ ] Session management

### 2. File Upload Security
- [ ] File type validation
- [ ] Size limit enforcement
- [ ] Malicious file detection

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- Individual functions and components
- Isolated business logic
- Utility functions

### Integration Tests
- Component interactions
- API endpoint workflows
- Database operations

### End-to-end Tests
- Complete user workflows
- Cross-component functionality
- Real-time features

## Test Environment Setup

### Frontend
- Jest with React Testing Library
- Mock Firebase services
- Canvas API mocking
- Router mocking

### Backend
- Pytest with FastAPI TestClient
- Mock Firebase Admin SDK
- Mock Google Cloud services
- Test database setup

## Coverage Goals
- Unit tests: 80%+ coverage
- Integration tests: Key workflows covered
- E2E tests: Critical user paths covered
